<div>
  <ul>
    <li>At<strong> ILLUMINOUS</strong> we extend the education by distribution of integrated study tools available online at one place. We have invested our priceless efforts to develop this system which is very elegant and easy to use for both students as well as the faculty.</li>
    <li> Our project is mainly intended to impart the knowledge for every student by creating an online virtual classroom with interactiveness. Our project implies the following features:</li>
  </ul>
  <ol>
    <li><strong>Short Videos:</strong> For understanding important concepts at a pinch of time.</li>
    <li><strong>File Sharing:</strong> For uploading user content as well as downloading required study material.</li>
    <li><strong>Feedback:</strong> For providing feedback to teachers as well as subjects.</li>
    <li><strong>Video Broadcasting:    </strong>For making the learning interactive by teacher-student interaction through video broadcasting.</li>
    <li><strong>Q&amp;A:</strong> For asking queries as well as answering queries via a chat interface.</li>
    <li><strong>Attendance Check:  </strong>For keeping a track of student attendance in the class. </li>
  </ol>
  <p>We are glad to present this project before all the learners who are willing to learn from their own workplace, by providing outstanding features with robustness, platform independence and ease of access at your fingertips. </p>
